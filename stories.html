In the first forty days a boy had been with him. But after forty days without a fish the boy's parents had told him that the old man was now definitely and finally salao, which is the worst form of unlucky, and the boy had gone at their orders in another boat which caught three good fish the first week. </p> <button class="btn card_btn">Read More</button> </div> </div> </li> <li class="cards_item"> <div class="card"> <div class="card_image"> <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/500x300?sea​​breezes"> </div> <div class="card_content"> <h2 class="card_title">"Moby-Dick" by Herman Melville</h2> <p class="card_text"> Call me Ishmael. Some years ago—never mind how long precisely—having little or no money in my purse, and nothing particular to interest me on shore, I thought I would sail about a little and see the watery part of the world.

The horizon narrowed and widened, and dipped and rose, and at all times its edge was jagged with waves that seemed thrust up in points like rocks. </p> <button class="btn card_btn">Read More</button> </div> </div> </li> <li class="cards_item"> <div class="card"> <div class="card_image"> <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/500x300?ocean"> </div> <div class="card_content"> <h2 class="card_title">“The Pearl” by John Steinbeck</h2> <p class="card_text"> "In the town they tell the story of the great pearl - how it was found and how it was lost again.
