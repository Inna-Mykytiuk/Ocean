              "In the town they tell the story of the great pearl - how it was
              found and how it was lost again. They tell of Kino, the fisherman,
              and of his wife, Juana, and of the baby, Coyotito. And because the
              story has been told so often, it has taken root in every man's
              mind. And, as with all retold tales that are in people's hearts,
              there are only good and bad things and black and white things and
              good and evil things and no in-between anywhere..."

              NONE of them knew the color of the sky. Their eyes glanced level,
              and were fastened upon the waves that swept toward them. These
              waves were of the hue of slate, save for the tops, which were of
              foaming white, and all of the men knew the colors of the sea. The
              horizon narrowed and widened, and dipped and rose, and at all
              times its edge was jagged with waves that seemed thrust up in
              points like rocks.
