              He was an old man who fished alone in a skiff in the Gulf Stream
              and he had gone eighty-four days now without taking a fish. In the
              first forty days a boy had been with him. But after forty days
              without a fish the boy's parents had told him that the old man was
              now definitely and finally salao, which is the worst form of
              unlucky, and the boy had gone at their orders in another boat
              which caught three good fish the first week.

              Call me Ishmael. Some years ago—never mind how long
              precisely—having little or no money in my purse, and nothing
              particular to interest me on shore, I thought I would sail about a
              little and see the watery part of the world. It is a way I have of
              driving off the spleen and regulating the circulation. Whenever I
              find myself growing grim about the mouth; whenever it is a damp,
              drizzly November in my soul;

              Until the extraordinary affair at Sidmouth, the peculiar species
              Haploteuthis ferox was known to science only generically, on the
              strength of a half-digested tentacle obtained near the Azores, and
              a decaying body pecked by birds and nibbled by fish, found early
              in 1896 by Mr. Jennings, near Land’s End. In no department of
              zoological science, indeed are we quite so much in the dark as
              with regard to the deep-sea cephalopods.

              Just after passing Caraher's saloon, on the County Road that ran
              south from Bonneville, and that divided the Broderson ranch from
              that of Los Muertos, Presley was suddenly aware of the faint and
              prolonged blowing of a steam whistle that he knew must come from
              the railroad shops near the depot at Bonneville. In starting out
              from the ranch house that morning, he had forgotten his watch...

              NONE of them knew the color of the sky. Their eyes glanced level,
              and were fastened upon the waves that swept toward them. These
              waves were of the hue of slate, save for the tops, which were of
              foaming white, and all of the men knew the colors of the sea. The
              horizon narrowed and widened, and dipped and rose, and at all
              times its edge was jagged with waves that seemed thrust up in
              points like rocks.

              story has been told so often, it has taken root in every man's

              there are only good and bad things and black and white things and
              good and evil things and no in-between anywhere..."
